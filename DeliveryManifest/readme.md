# Delivery Manifest

The delivery manifest was created to provide our delivery drivers and easy to generate, DOT compliant manifest for their daily routes. Previously, our drivers had to record all their stops, pick tickets and weights by hand. With this new custom report, we leveage the P21 database to generate a manifest with much richer data than a driver could ever record by hand.

The delivery manifest uses the Proof Of Delivery functionality in P21. Specifically, you have to create a "delivery list" in P21 which provides the data to the manifest report.
